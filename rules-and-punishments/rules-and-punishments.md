# Rules and punishments

## General staff considerations

1\. When punishing a player for their actions a staff member should always have regard to the player's intentions.

2\. As a general rule, staff members should be lenient. In most cases, a private warning sufficient in the first instance.

## Repeat offences

3\. When a player has repeatedly and consistently gone against the rules, subsequent offences should no longer be considered as minor.

## Griefing
4\. It is against the rules to grief another player. This includes, but is not limited to, knowingly:
* causing damage to someone else's property
* hampering someone else's enjoyment of the game
* limiting someone else's progress through the game
* killing someone else's animals without their permission
* intentionally and purposely causing the server to lag
* trolling.

5\. Griefing can be punished by a temporary or permanent ban.

6\. In cases where the griefing is minor in the opinion of the staff member, a private warning is sufficient.

7\. In cases where the griefing is major in the opinion of the staff member and the staff member believes the player has no intention to follow the servers rules in the future, a permanent ban should be issued.

8\. A one to two week temporary ban is sufficient in most other cases. The staff member has discretion if they believe a shorter or longer ban is appropriate.

## Stealing, luring and scamming
9\. It is against the rules to steal from, lure or scam another player. This includes, but is not limited to:
* taking items from someone else's chests
* taking someone's items after they die
* having someone teleport to you in the hope they lose their items
* purposely giving someone a bad deal by withholding information (e.g. selling a mending book with curse of binding).

10\. Stealing, luring and theft can be punished by a temporary or permanent ban.

11\. In cases where the offence is minor in the opinion of the staff member, or the player and the victim are able to reconcile, a private warning is sufficient.

12\. In cases where the offence is major in the opinion of the staff member and the staff member believes the player has no intention to follow the servers rules in the future, a permanent ban should be issued.

13\. A one to two week temporary ban is sufficient in most other cases. The staff member has discretion if they believe a shorter or longer ban is appropriate.

## Cheats and exploits
14\. It is against the rules to use cheats or exploit glitches and game design flaws. This includes, but is not limited to:
* duping
* x-ray mods, texture packs or glitches
* auto-mining mods
* any mod that provides a significant advantage over other players.

15\. For the purpose of this section, and despite 14, the following are not cheats or exploits:
* accessing and using the nether ceiling
* minimap mods
* autoclickers.

16\. Cheating and exploiting can be punished by a temporary or permanent ban.

17\. In cases where the offence is minor in the opinion of the staff member, a private warning is sufficient.

18\. In cases where the offence is major in the opinion of the staff member and the staff member believes the player has no intention to follow the servers rules in the future, a permanent ban should be issued.

19\. A one to two week temporary ban is sufficient in most other cases. The staff member has discretion if they believe a shorter or longer ban is appropriate.

## Disrespectful behaviour
20\. It is against the rules to be disrespectful towards other people. This includes, but is not limited to:
* making derogatory remarks about a person or group of persons based on their personal beliefs or attributes.

21\. Disrespectful behaviour can be punished by a mute or permanent ban.

22\. In cases where the offence is minor in the opinion of the staff member, a private warning is sufficient.

23\. In the case where the offence is major in the opinion of the staff member and the staff member believes the player has no intention to follow the servers rules in the future, a permanent ban should be issued.

24\. A one to two day mute is sufficient in most other cases. The staff member has discretion if they believe a shorter or longer mute is appropriate.

## Profanity
25\. It is against the rules to use profanity on the server, whether that be in chat, on signs, in books, in item names, or any other medium.

26\. Use of profanity can be punished by a mute.

27\. In cases where the offence is minor in the opinion of the staff member, a private warning is sufficient.

28\. A 10 to 60 minute mute is sufficient in most other cases. The staff member has discretion if they believe a short or longer mute is appropriate.

## Advertising
29\. It is against the rules to use the server as a medium for advertising.

30\. A player should be considered to be advertising only if they are consistently or expressely using the server to make better known to other players a link, server or other service that is uncalled-for in the given context or generates financial benefits for that player. This includes, but is not limited to:
* directing other players to affiliate links
* joining the server expressly to direct players to a different server or link
* in contexts uncalled-for, linking players to a non-FroobWorld related Discord server.

31\. For the avoidance of doubt, the following examples should not be considered advertising:
* where context calls for it, providing another player a recommendation for a product they are not affiliated with
* inviting a friend to play on another server.

32\. Advertising can be punished by a mute.

33\. In cases where the offence is minor in the opinion of the staff member, a private warning is sufficient.

34\. A 10 to 60 minute mute is sufficient in most other cases. The staff member has discretion if they believe a shorter or longer mute is appropriate.
