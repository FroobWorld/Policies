1\. In order to be eligible for consideration of the Trusted role a player must:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) have joined the server at least three months ago; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) have been active on the server over the last month; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) be of good standing in the community.

2\. Any staff member can nominate an eligible player for the Trusted role.

3\. It will be up to the admins to make a judgement on the nominated player's fitness for the role.

4\. Although there is no set limit to the number of Trusted, if it is thought the number of Trusted is becoming excessively large the admins should reserve new appointments to only the most exceptional nominations.

5\. If there is general agreeance amongst the admins the player may be made Trusted.
